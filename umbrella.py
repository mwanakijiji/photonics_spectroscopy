from extraction import extract

# initialize logging



# define the input data directory to monitor

# figure out which data this is

# basic reductions: dark-subt etc.

# figure out the footprint

# chop up

# extract spectrum
extract()

# write out extracted data

# keep logging


## wish list for Julien:
# - dark
# - flat (if that is used)
# - frames at different lambda and through each 'channel' or 'spaxel' or whatever the equivalent is
